Problems during implementation:
- Generics for NodeList gives method overloading problems for Visitor Pattern during lack of <?> in C#. There are only workaround solutions,
so chosen for cast solution without generics.
- List type is not enumerable which gives overhead when converting to array's
- No DOM model for XHTML, only for XML which is not simple compatible with XHTML.
- XHTMLWriter which is available is not friendly to use. It doesn't use an tree based approach but just writes to output buffer
